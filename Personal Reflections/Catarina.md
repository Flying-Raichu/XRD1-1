# Catarina’s Personal Reflection 

This document will approach my reflection regarding my role in the team, my contributions in the work done, technical issues, decisions made and what should be improved. 

Regarding the creative process of both projects I took a very active role, with emphasis on the XR project, where the ideas were taken and developed later into feature mechanics. 

 

## Regarding my technical contributions: 

### For the AR Project: 

-Built on the sun mechanics in order for it to maintain a constant position and made a first material for the sun. 

-Developed the base mechanics for the orbiting of the planets. 

-Participated in joint debugging sessions. 

 

### For the VR project : 

 
For the VR project, I was responsible for the core design, implementation, and technical execution of the experience. 

- Built the entire temple environment, including scene layout, spatial composition, lighting, and material assignment. 

-Implemented UI interfaces for both introduction and ending in order to provide the player with further game context as well as to provide closure once the game ends. 

-Implemented the core gameplay mechanics: the three puzzles. These were built with the player in mind in order to create a satisfactory chain of events that lead the player to the surprising finale. 

-Debugging thoroughly and often throughout the development process 

- Configured and used the Unity device simulator to test VR interactions efficiently. 

-Investigated on the functionalities and deployment of projects to the VR headsets were made  

- Coordinated later-stage debugging  with my teammate, who assisted during final fixes. 

 

## Technical Issues 

The biggest technical issue was the fact that several features were worked on at the same time. This is not a good practice and this is not how a project should be built, but it was a decision made being aware of such. This decision was conducted due to poor workload management of the team. Initially the team wanted all team members to work on the project equally, but it ended up not being possible as some AR changes were taking a lot of time to fully function. Therefore, at a very late stage, the team decided the best decision was for me to begin to build the VR project. Due to the very limited amount of time available , I took the decision to work on several features in parallel. This way, each branch was viewed as a testing zone were all features could be tested separately and then combined together by copying the self produced code into a new branch and merged. While this approach improved the productivity in short-term, it increased the risk of  issues occurring, specially regarding scene management and version control.  

While merging the features, there were issues regarding the scene files, which should have been accounted for, as the merging of changes accidentally overwrote global scene configurations. Unfortunately, the issues were not fixed in time and the team was not able to show the VR project in the expo that happened. The required fixes for the project were able to be made and the team delivered both functional projects in time of the deadline. 

 

## Conclusions and improvements for the future 

The main takeaway would be better time and workload management – had the team decided earlier that the workload would have been the way it turned out to, the VR game would have been better developed, and with the intended detail it was intended to. 

Technically wise, to not work on different features at the same time under no circumstance and to gather more time to invest of improving user comfortability such as adjusting the transitions between/UI as they could be smoother, improving the detail in the scene in general (e.g. improving the lighting, adding props like trees and herbs on the walls) and also adjust some more details regarding the textures and size proportions to create a more comfortable environment for the user.
