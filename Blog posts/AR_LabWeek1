#AR Project- Lab Week 1

**On the computer - Lyubomir**
**Writting the post - Catarina**

Since we are just two people, we decided that in each lab week one of us is typing in the computer while we work together and the other person 
then writes the blog post, and then switching roles in each lab session.

Firstly the setup was made, using the Unity Editor with the Android build support module and a basic AR template. Trying to research some more guidance on the 
internet (websites linked below), the goal for this lab session was to be able to project a yellow sphere from a card from an android phone. 
Later on, it was decided to try to do something even simpler first and therefore the goal became to have the sun be projected on a plane. To do so, we 
followed the Unity AR tutorial (also linked below). Firstly, a plane manager component was created to initiate and manage what is going on on the plane. 
Then an AR default plane was created and set as a prefab on the plane manager, with the intention of serving as a place to first project our sphere from. Then a 
sun object was created and attributed a material (of color yellow). Using the code from the tutorial, the following entities were established on the script:

 -> Plane manager component, as previously mentioned for general initiation of the plane entities
 -> AR Raycast manager, as to control what is existing on top of the plan
 -> A reference point list, to gather all the points detected in order to project entities onto the plane
 -> A reference point manager, to manage all te points gathered and their interactions with each other

After setting our sphere with the dimensions stated on the tutorial, we attempted to build and run the project, which did not work because we forgot to delete
some default instances that came with the template. When running again, we ran into problems as the sphere was not visible, even when tapping on the screen. That 
was fixed by rearranging the camara position.
