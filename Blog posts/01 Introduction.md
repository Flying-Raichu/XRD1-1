# The "What" and "Why" of XR

When we talk about extended reality, or XR, we’re not just talking about a single technology: we’re talking about an umbrella that covers Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, and Augmented Virtuality. These terms often get used interchangeably, but each highlights a different point on the relationship between the real and the virtual.

**VR** immerses the user entirely in a digital environment, blocking out the physical world. Here we're talking about things like VRChat.

**AR** overlays digital content onto the real world: think Pokémon GO or smart glasses that project navigation hints.

**MR** blends real and virtual elements that can interact with each other, like a holographic character that sits on your desk and reacts when you move objects around it. Often, the differences between AR and MR are blurry, but MR very much focuses on the virtual **interacting** with the real world. An example here would be MS HoloLens placing a robot on your desk that can manouver around obstacles.

**AV** is less commonly discussed but refers to mostly virtual environments with small elements of the real world brought in (for example, displaying a real-world keyboard inside a VR workspace).
Together, **XR** represents this whole medium, emphasizing the idea that digital and physical realities can be combined in multiple ways to shape human experience.

# How XR Differs from Traditional Apps

Compared to desktop or mobile applications, XR is not just about displaying information but about situating that information in space and inviting the user into it. Traditional apps rely on screens, windows, and flat interactions like taps or clicks. XR applications leverage spatial computing, gestures, eye tracking, and even full-body movement.

This shift introduces advantages such as higher immersion, intuitive spatial interaction, and the ability to visualize complex data in 3D. For example, medical students can “walk around” a virtual human body, seeing systems layer by layer, instead of flipping through 2D diagrams. At the same time, XR faces challenges: hardware remains bulky, software can be expensive to produce, and comfort—both physical and cognitive: has yet to reach the effortless level of mobile devices.

Then there are the technical limitations of the hardware running VR applications: It remains difficult to optimize an XR experience with the technical specifications of modern computers in such a way that immersion is kept. There is also a consideration towards framerates that must be made, due to the dangers of adverse health effects, spanning from nausea to fatigue.

# Use Cases and Value

The potential of XR spans industries:

Education & Training: Safe, repeatable practice environments for surgeons, pilots, or factory workers.

**Entertainment:** Games and immersive storytelling that let users “be there.”

**Healthcare:** Therapy for phobias, pain management through distraction, or rehabilitation through guided exercises.

**Collaboration & Work:** Virtual offices where teams gather in 3D, whiteboard together, and feel presence despite physical distance.

**Design & Engineering:** Architects walking through buildings before they’re built, car designers prototyping at scale without physical materials.

For end users, XR’s value often boils down to immersion and presence: the feeling of being “inside” an experience instead of just looking at it. This deeper connection not only enhances engagement but can also improve retention of knowledge, empathy in storytelling, and creativity in problem-solving.

# Today vs. Tomorrow

Right now, XR technology is promising but imperfect. Devices like the Meta Quest or HoloLens offer glimpses of the future but still struggle with field of view, resolution, battery life, and affordability. The idealistic vision imagines lightweight, stylish glasses with seamless digital overlays, natural hand-and-eye interactions, and integration so smooth that XR becomes as commonplace as smartphones are today.

# Why XR Matters

At its heart, XR is not just another platform: it’s a new medium of interaction. By placing humans inside their information environments, XR can help solve problems of comprehension (visualizing data in 3D), distance (connecting people as if they share a room), and even empathy (letting someone see the world from another perspective).

The “what” of XR is clear: a set of technologies blending real and digital. The “why” is more profound: XR gives us tools to extend our senses, our presence, and our ability to engage with the world in ways traditional screens never could.
